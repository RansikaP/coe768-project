##Introduction
This project is a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) application that consists of the main index server and several peer servers. This application allows the peers to exchange content amongst each other with the assistance of the index server which acts as a middleman to prepare the peers and their content to be shared among each other. A peer could have a piece of data such as a text file or song available for download for other peers, respectively called the content server and content client respectively. The index server is the one that organizes all these peersâ€™ content and acts like a table of content for the other peers to know where the desired content is located. A peer can also be a content server of more than one piece of content, as well as being a content client to another peer. The communication between the index server and a peer is based on UDP, while a peer-to-peer content download is on TCP for more reliability. When a socket is created it is bound to an address and port number. Then the server will wait for the peers to attempt a connection. If the connection is successful a socket connection will be created between the peer and server, or peer to peer. As mentioned above, for peer-to-peer content download TCP sockets are used and for peer, to server communication, UDP sockets are used.
